# To use the evaluation scripts, you need to set your GitHub personal access token
# that has access to GitHub Models.
#
# 1. Copy this file to .env (remove .sample extension)
# 2. Replace 'your_github_token_here' with your actual GitHub personal access token
# 3. Make sure your token has the necessary permissions for GitHub Models
#
# Example:
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
